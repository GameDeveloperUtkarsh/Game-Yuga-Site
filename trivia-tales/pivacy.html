    </header>

    <main>
        <p>Welcome to Trivia Tales, a quiz game developed by Game Yuga. This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Trivia Tales collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users ("Users") of the Trivia Tales application ("App"). This Privacy Policy applies to the App and all products and services offered by Game Yuga.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In-Game Username:</strong> We collect the username chosen by the User within the game. However, we do not store the username of players whose scores do not surpass the last leaderboard entry. This information is stored in Firebase's database for the purpose of creating leaderboards and enhancing the gaming experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Reported Questions:</strong> When a User reports a question within the game, we collect information related to the reported question. This data aids in improving the quality and accuracy of our trivia questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase's Database:</strong> In-game usernames and reported questions are stored in Firebase's database. The security and privacy practices of Firebase adhere to industry standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Device Storage:</strong> Game progress data, including levels completed, scores achieved, and other in-game activities, is stored locally on the User's device. This data is not accessible to us and is solely retained for enhancing the gaming experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> The leaderboard is dynamic and subject to frequent changes. Usernames of players whose scores are lower than the leaderboard's last entry are not stored in our database to ensure accurate and up-to-date rankings.</li>
            <li><strong>Reported Questions:</strong> Reported questions are cleared on a daily basis after the identified issues have been addressed. This ensures that the reported questions do not accumulate unnecessarily and maintains the quality of the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Target Age</h2>
        <p>Trivia Tales is intended for users aged 9 and above. We may collect information from all users in this age group in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
