    <h1>Privacy Policy for Way Out</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [April 4, 2025]</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Game Yuga</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users of Way Out. This includes, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, location data, or device identifiers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. AdMob Advertising</h2>
        <p>Way Out displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob, a third-party advertising network. While we do not collect data ourselves, AdMob may collect and use certain information (such as device identifiers and usage data) to serve contextual or interest-based ads, in accordance with their own privacy practices.</p>
        <p>Because Way Out is directed at children under the age of 13, we have configured AdMob to serve only child-appropriate, non-personalized ads, in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and relevant Google Play policies.</p>
        <p>For more information on how AdMob handles user data, please refer to: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Way Out is designed for a general audience and may appeal to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children. In compliance with COPPA, we have taken steps to ensure that any third-party services used in the game do not collect personal information from children either.</p>
        <p>If a parent or guardian believes that we have inadvertently collected personal data from their child, they may contact us at <a href="mailto:game.yuga.studio@gmail.com">game.yuga.studio@gmail.com</a>, and we will promptly take steps to remove such information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>Way Out does not contain direct links to external websites or social media platforms. All ads shown are managed through AdMob and comply with their child-safe advertising standards.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or made available via the app store listing. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any updates.</p>
